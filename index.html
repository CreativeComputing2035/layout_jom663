			About me.<br>
			It was a long journey for me to find my interest and my road. There were several faliures and several mistakes. However, I still think it was necessary for me.<br>
            Before I decided to learn design, I majored in Enlish Literature and Language. It was not that I didn't enjoyed my studies, but it was that I could not see where this leads me to.<br>
            I hope I made the right choice. But even if it wasn't I have no regret.<br>
